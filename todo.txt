  - quickly read some tutorial, what typical mistakes to avoid
  * script:
    * "title screenshot" with text and C64
    * face: "welcome"
    * phone: C64, sound on
    * phone: follow midi cable to pc "sound coming from..."
    * screen: "here"
    * face: "let's demo"
    * screen: modify inputs
    * face: "so, very low level, ideas welcome for other modules that"
            "produce signals to this from 'higher level' concepts"
	    "For example ripped register dumps (which I have done)"
    * face: "this for user, now I'll show some details of how it works"
    * screen: connect to midiprinter, on same screen
              slow down clock
	      demo e.g. adsr
    * face: "thanks for watching, ideas welcome, panel design, ..."
            "link to github in the notes"

- minimal sane correct sysex dump
  + correct dump length
  + defaults in dump
    + volume up
    + o1 adsr 12C2 (or something where you hear nontrivial envelope)
  + freq offset+cv to freq
  - cross-verify dump content with java-code

- why does real test with 8vert give weird waveforms values?
  * logging shows that I'm probably converting wrong
  * but the same values in test work

- test out of bounds with float->nybble
  - volume, wf

- separate gate for chan 3 off? If yes, allow only filtermode bits
  to be set by filter mode float

- handle a full register at a time: no risk of handling parts in
  broken order

- freq: correct v/oct, calibrated to sid range
